  <p align="center"><img src="./option2.png"></p>  
  
  <h2>General Options</h2>
  <h3>Option</h3>
  <p>Here you can changes various option about the disassembler engine:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="./option3.png"></p> 
<p>
 <ul>
  <li><b>Illegal opcode style</b>: changes the mode as undocument instructions are called as they are not standard:
     <ol>
      <li>ANE, ISB, SHY, SHS: Mode use by John west and Marko M"akel"a</li>
      <li>AXA, ISC, SYH, SSH: Mode use by Juergen Buchmueller</li>
      <li>XAA, INS, SAY, TAS: Mode use by Adam Vardy</li>
     </ol>     
  </li>
  <li><b>Language of comments</b>: automatic comments added by disassembler engine can be in English or Italian</li>
  <li><b>Memory value in left panel</b>: select the format from exadecimal or char for the value in the merory panel table</li>
  <li><b>Type of dots (sprite/char) in comment:</b> select to use ASCII chars or UTF16 chars for dots of sprites/chars used in comment to show the outfit<br>
       <img src="./option23.png"> 
  </li>
  <li><b>Opcode formatting as Upper case (NOP, JMP, ...) insteas of Lower case (nop, jmp, ...) for preview</b>: in preview of source uses upper or lower text case formatting</li>
  <li><b>Opcode formatting as Upper case (NOP, JMP, ...) insteas of Lower case (nop, jmp, ...) for source</b>: in source uses upper or lower text case formatting</li>
  <li><b>Erase disassembler automatic comment when mark a memory location as Data:</b> when you mark a memory location as data you can choose if the automatic comment (that is assed for code) should be erased as not more useful</li>
  <li><b>Erase relative + address when mark a memory location as Data</b>: as relative plus association are done in automatic onto code, you can choose that it will be erased if you mark the memory location as of data</li>
  <li><b>Undefined code/data used as code instead of data</b>: select how undefinde memory location should be managed (code or data)</li>
  <li><b>A click on UC column edit the user comment</b>: activate an alterative way to add/edit user comment</li>
  <li><b>A click on UB column edit the global comment</b>: activate an alterative way to add/edit global comemnt</li>
  <li><b>A click on UL column edit the user label</b>: activate an alternative way to add/edit user label</li>    
  <li><b>A click on DC column erase the automatic comment</b>: activate an alternative way to delete automatic comment</li>    
  <li><b>A click on DL column erase the automatic label</b>: activate an alternative way to delete automatic label</li>    
  <li><b>A click on VL column allow to patch the value</b>: activate a fast way to add patch</li>    
  <li><b>Label is on separate line from instructio</b>: chnage the way a label is showed inside the code</li>
  <li><b>Force compilation at every modification</b>: at every modification you made the source is generated again. Takes present that in long source code the bottleneck is probably the highlighting of it in preview and source panel rather that the source generation itself</li>   
  <li><b>Allow UTF chars in text/char definitions</b>: UTF char are used if they compile back to right binary code</li>
  <li><b>Repositionate memory from preview after compilation</b>: current position in preview is used to repositionate in memory if it is on an address after the commpilation</li>
  <li><b>Allow result message for load/save</b>: show the result of loading and saving operation</li>
  <li><b>Code with undocument opcodes are forced to be of data type</b>: automatically force code to be data to avoid the use of illegal opcodes</li>
  <li><b>Show miniature scrollbars</b>: use a right miniature of the source dor better slelecting area</li>
  <li><b>Merge adjacent blocks</b>: merge blocks that intersect, for a better disassembly</li>
  <li><b>Project file chooser shows colored icons based onto % of disassembly</b>: this slow down the file opening when there are manu files in the directory, but the colored icons gives an idea of percentual of disassembly (it is not precise for being quick)</li>
  <li><b>Show SIDid player information</b>: use the Sidid.cfg for showing the player if it is recognized</li>
  <li><b>Create PSID header:</b> create values in source for regenerating the binary as a PSID file and not PRG for tune. 
      <ul>

  <li><b>Temp path for assembler compilation:</b> a path used for generating the binary of assembler. The best way is to use a memory drive (/tmp in most of Linux ditribution for example) as the generated files are to be considearte temporary</li>
  <li><b>SIDid configuration file:</b> the path to the Sidiid.cfg file used by SIDid program to determine the player</li>
 </ul>
 The disassembler engine used the SidFreq class implemented in XSidplay2 for detecting the A4 frequency that a tune is playing by searching in memory for the low and high part of table frequency of the octaves the SID can play.<br>
 Where such area is find, it will be marked ad data kind and the label for low and high position are generated as user label and a comment is added for giving the A4 frequency information<br>
 From version 1.6 the engine is called multiple times to find possible more blocks of notes data. In such cases, the label will then be marked with index, 1, 2, 3...

 <h3>Disassembler</h3> 
 <p>Here you activate the assembler to use and so the corresponding syntax format for the source code</p>
 <p align="center"><img src="./option13.png"></p> 
 <p>The option varies from assembler to assembler and are divided into: </p>
 <ul>
     <li><b>Starting</b>: starting directiver for compilation</li>

     <li><b>Block comment</b>: the syntax for declaring a block comment</li>
     <li><b>Label</b>: the syntax for declaring a label. Always a label start from the first column of row even if some assembler support starting in other columns</li>
     <li><b>Byte</b>: the syntax for declaring a byte. It shows the four kind of way you can define a byte area, but you cannot differentiate the synstax throw the different methods</li>
     <li><b>Word</b>: the syntax for declaring a word</li>
     <li><b>Word swapped</b>: the syntax for declaring a word swapped. For compatibility with assemblers that not support this kind of data, in that case a macro is used</li>

     <li><b>Text</b>: the syntax for declaring a text area</li>
     <li><b>Text with # of char before</b>: the syntax for declaring a text where the number of char is the first byte. If the assembler did not support this it is managed as normal text</li>
     <li><b>Text 0 terminated</b>: the syntax for declaring a text that terminate with a zero byte. If the assembler did not support this it is managed as normal text</li>
     <li><b>Text '1' terminated</b>: the syntax for declaring a text that termintate with the high bit to 1. If the assembler did not support this it is managed as normal text</li>
     <li><b>Text left shifted</b>: the syntax for declaring a text that is left shifted by 1 bit. If the assembler did not support this it is managed as normal text</li>
     <li><b>Text to screen code</b>: the syntax for declaring a text that uses screen code. If the assembler did not support this it is managed as normal text</li>

</p>

<h3>SIDFreq</h3>
<p>Here you can select what kind of table the SID frequency catcher has to use</p>

  
 <h2>Apply SIDLD flags to memory</h2>
 We saw that for a project you can add some files of SIDLD that has the code/data attribution about memory locations by true playback of the SID tune.<br>
 If you had such files you can apply the attribution with this function. It is manual as otherwise it will prevent you to change a data/code area by hand if it is applyed at every disassambly.<br>
 The right way to use it is so to apply it on the fitst time, otherwise it can overwrite your memory/code previous selection.

 <h2>View Project</h2>
 <p>This menu will open the dialog box used for creating the project. 
  Here you can still going to add other SIDLD files or changing the file to disassemble.
</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="./option4.png"></p> 
  
  <h2>View Labels</h2>  
  <p>This menu will open the dialog box that lists all the labels used into the disassambly.<br>
  With click onto a line, that memory address will be selected into the principal memory table. A Ctrl+ doucle click will positionate (if possible) event the source preview in that line
