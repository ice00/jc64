  <h1 align="center">JC64dis Memory menu</h1>
  <p>The file menu is dedicated to the memory area, and so have many voices:<br></p>

  <h2>Clear dasm automatic comment</h2>
  <p>During the disassemble phase, the Dasm engine is able to add some comments to common C64 memory locations used by the instruction being executed.<br>
    So, for example, if the address of an load/store instruction is $D400, the automatic comment appended to that memory area will be "Voice 1: Frequency control (lo byte)"<br>
    You can use those comments to easy search for some text (eg. "Frequency control"), however if you don't need it, you can use this menu function to erase the comments and leave them blank to all the memory location you had delected<br>
    Please, note that as soon as you will regenerate the source code, the DASM will add again that comment, so instead of erasing it, it silenty add a user comment (see Add user comment) that is blank as the rule applied in the engine is that a user comment is always used over a Dasm automatic comment.
  </p>
  <h2>Clear user comment</h2>
 <p>This is a shortcut function for make your comment to that location as blank (e.g you can enter the comment and modify it to be empty, but this fastest).</p>
 <h2>Clear dasm automatic label</h2>
 <p>The Dasm engine is able to detect all the memory location used into the program area and label them as "W" + the hex representation of the memory area.<br>
  This command will erase that association, but if it still present into the source it will be recreated at next Dasm source regeneration. So why this function is present?<br>
  The answer is simple: at the beginning all memory locations are not marked as code/data, so the engine use them as code (by default in option). <br>
  In this phase that could be a data area that if managed as code refers to a givem memory location and so that will be labeled. 
  When you will mark that area as code, the label is still associated, so it could appars when it is utilizated as data.
 </p>
  <h2>Add user comment</h2> 
  <p>This function let you add a comment to the selected memory area. The comment is used over a Dasm automatic one and in source appears in the line where there is the code.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="./memory3.png"></p> 
  <p>Note instead that a comment into the data area will appears only if there is a label and it will be after the label declaration (this let to merge more bytes to one row).</p>
  <h2>Add user block comment</h2> 
  <p>This function is essential for adding the right formatting to the source and appropriate comments to block of code.<br>
  The fist usage is for adding blank lines and so separating parts of code or data. The rule is simple: add a space (only one) and a carriage return (and iterate more times as you need). That char will add a blank line, otherwise you will gene a line with ; (a comment) that it is not goot to read.<br><br>
  Here an example with data that are separated every 8 lines (so we have a block of 8x8 area): you can see the comment inside memort address $2040
  <p align="center"><img src="./memory4.png"></p> 
  <p>All other values inserted will be addes as ; and your comment, so for example, here a screen that show what it was inserted in comment and what you got:</p>
   <p align="center"><img src="./memory5.png"></p>  
  
   <h2>Mark as code</h2>
   <h2>Mark as data</h2>
   <h2>Assign the selected address as +</h2>
   <h2>Assign the selected address as #< </h2>
   <h2>Assign the selected address as #> </h2>
