  <h1 align="center">JC64dis Memory menu</h1>
  <p>The file menu is dedicated to the memory area, and so have many voices:<br></p>

  <h2>Clear disassembly automatic comment</h2>
  <p>During the disassemble phase, the disassembly engine is able to add some comments to common memory locations (based onto the choosed platform) used by the instruction being executed.<br>
    So, for example, if the address of an load/store instruction is $D400, the automatic comment appended to that memory area will be "Voice 1: Frequency control (lo byte)"<br>
    You can use those comments to easy search for some text (eg. "Frequency control"), however if you don't need it, you can use this menu function to erase the comments and leave them blank to all the memory location you had delected<br>
    Please, note that as soon as you will regenerate the source code, the disassembler will add again that comment, so instead of erasing it, it silenty add a user comment (see Add user comment) that is blank as the rule applied in the engine is that a user comment is always used over a disassembler automatic comment.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Clear user comment</h2>
 <p>This is a shortcut function for make your comment to that location as blank (e.g you can enter the comment and modify it to be empty, but this fastest).</p>
 <h2>Clear disassembly automatic label</h2>
 <p>The disassembly engine is able to detect all the memory location used into the program area and label them as "W" + the hex representation of the memory area.<br>
  This command will erase that association, but if it still present into the source it will be recreated at next disassembler source regeneration. So why this function is present?<br>
  The answer is simple: at the beginning all memory locations are not marked as code/data, so the engine use them as code (by default in option). <br>
  In this phase that could be a data area that if managed as code refers to a givem memory location and so that will be labeled. 
  When you will mark that area as code, the label is still associated, so it could appars when it is utilizated as data.
 </p>
 
  <h2>Add user comment</h2> 
  <p>This function let you add a comment to the selected memory area. The comment is used over a disassembler automatic one and in source appears in the line where there is the code.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="./memory3.png"></p> 
  <p>Note instead that a comment into the data area will appears only if there is a label and it will be after the label declaration (this let to merge more bytes to one row).</p>
  
  <h2>Add user block comment</h2> 
  <p>This function is essential for adding the right formatting to the source and appropriate comments to block of code.<br>
  The fist usage is for adding blank lines and so separating parts of code or data. The rule is simple: add a space (only one) and a carriage return (and iterate more times as you need). That char will add a blank line, otherwise you will gene a line with ; (a comment) that it is not good to read.<br><br>
  Here an example with data that are separated every 8 lines (so we have a block of 8x8 area): you can see the comment inside memort address $2040
  <p align="center"><img src="./memory4.png"></p> 
  <p>All other values inserted will be addes as ; and your comment, so for example, here a screen that show what it was inserted in comment and what you got:</p>
   <p align="center"><img src="./memory5.png"></p>  
   
   <h2>Add user label</h2> 
   <p>The user can add label to a memory location in data or code area and if there was a disassembly automatic generated one in that position, the user will be used instead of the other.<br>
   You cannot insert label with less than 5 chars and a option let you specify the max one to use (as some assembler has a limit in his length). <br>
   The program will search if the label was already present into the code, so you cannot create duplicates.
   As we had seen, disassembler generate labels only for memory locations inside the binary data, but a user can add a label even in the outside area (so as a constant).<br>
   This is for mark up external routine (like the KERNAL one) or memory area where to copy some code/data.<br><br>
   The engine of source generation processes the memory outside the binary data first, so block comments and label declaration will appears into the source into the initial area, then it process the internal memory area.<br>
   During the constant declaration even user comment are shoed:

   <h2>Mark as code</h2>
   <p>The selected area will be marked as code (so color will be green)</p>
   
   <h2>Mark as data</h2>
   <p>The selected area will be marked as data (so color will be light blue).<br>
   Note that you can enhance the classification by selecting the kind in a sub menu. The disassembly engine in that case apply a different decoding of the data.
   </p>
   
   <h2>Mark data as Byte (HEX)</h2>
   This marks the data as byte and format it as hexadecimal number. According with the selected assembler and his possible variants the format could be many, for example:<br>
   <b>.byte $12</b> or <b>!byte $F4</b><br>
   This is the method used when you select the data type without a further classification.
   
   <h2>Mark data as Byte (DEC)</h2>
   This marks the data as byte and format it as decimal number. According with the selected assembler and his possible variants the format could be many, for example:<br>
   <b>.byte 18</b> or <b>!byte 244</b>
   
   <h2>Mark data as Byte (BIN)</h2>
   This marks the data as byte and format it as decimal number. According with the selected assembler and his possible variants the format could be many, for example:<br>
   <b>.byte 18</b> or <b>!byte 244</b>
   
   <h2>Mark data as Byte (CHAR)</h2>
   This marks the data as byte and format it as character. According with the selected assembler and his possible variants the format could be many, for example:<br>
   <b>.byte 'A</b> or <b>!byte 'Z</b>
   
   <h2>Mark data as Word</h2>
   This marks the data as word and format it as hexadecimal number. According with the selected assembler and his possible variants the format could be many, for example:<br>
   <a>.word $1234</a> or <a>!word $1234</a><br>
   The data <i><$xxyy</i> are equivalent to the bytes <i>$yy, $xx</i>, so if those bytes are of a memory relative location (low/high), the word is replaced by the associate label, so those are equivalent:<br>
   <b>.byte &lt;Label, &gt;Label</b> and <b>.word Label</b>
   
   <h2>Mark data as Tribyte</h2>
   This marks the data as tribyte and format it as hexadecimal number. As not all the assembler supports tribyte, it will be used macro in that case.<br>
   Eventual memory address pointers (#<, #>) in one of the tribyte are not supported.
   
   <h2>Mark data as Long</h2>
   This marks the data as long and format it as hexadecimal number. As not all the assembler supports tribyte, it will be used macro in that case.<br>
   Eventual memory address pointers (#<, #>) in one of the long are not supported.
   
   <h2>Mark data as Monocromatic spite definitions</h2>
   This marks data as of a monocromatic spite definitions, so it expects to have multiple of 64 bytes. The disassembler puts group of line of 3 bytes for 21 lines, then it puts only a byte for closing the block.<br>
   The disasssembler will add a comment at the end of each line with the bits layout of the sprite (you can suppress them by delete the generated comments)<br>
   For the sprites, in option, you can choose to puts the 3 bytes as hexadecimal or binary number. Has not all assembler program supports tribyte number, it is used macro definitions to support them.<br>
   Labels are supported but in front of a sprite row, if it is inside the row, the row is splitted into bytes. Eventual memory address pointers (#<, #>) in one byte of the row are not supported.
   
   <h2>Mark data as Multicolor spite definitions</h2>
   This marks data as of a molticolor spite definitions, so it expects to have multiple of 64 bytes. The disassembler puts group of line of 3 bytes for 21 lines, then it puts only a byte for closing the block.<br>
   The disasssembler will add a comment at the end of each line with the bits layout of the sprite (you can suppress them by delete the generated comments)<br>
   For the sprites, in option, you can choose to puts the 3 bytes as hexadecimal or binary number. Has not all assembler program supports tribyte number, it is used macro definitions to support them.<br>
   Labels are supported but in front of a sprite row, if it is inside the row, the row is splitted into bytes.  Eventual memory address pointers (#<, #>) in one byte of the row are not supported.
   
   <h2>Assign the selected address as +</h2>
   <p>In some cases, accessing a sequences of byte referring to an initial address (and so label) can improve source clearance, instead of creating one label for every bytes:</p>
   <p align="center"><img src="./memory7.png"></p>   
   <p>Using this function you can create such relation: you need to positionate to the element you want to make point to another, then into the given table you can choose one address (that can have a label, but if it is not present, disassembler engine will create one for it). At this point the label of this address will not be used and instead will be used the one that are associated with the offest for it.<br>
   You will see that now the RE column will have a + inside it and the tool tip will gives the address + offset. </p>
   <p align="center"><img src="./memory8.png"></p> 
   <p>You should note that the disassembler engine will create in automatic a such relation in one particular case: where there is a self modified code!<br>
   A common way to save raster line or write compact code is to modify the low/high byte of the address of an LDA or STA instruction. 
   In this case you cannot create a label to that memory location as it is inside the code, so you must refer to it as another (usually labelling where the instruction start) plus an offset:</p>
   <p align="center"><img src="./memory9.png"></p> 
   <p>You can delete a plus relation by simple using the function and selecting only Ok: the program will ask you if you want to delete it. It even useful when disassembler engine create a relation to part that where not marked as code and then you mark as data.  </p>
  
   <h2>Assign the selected address as -</h2>
   <p>In some cases even having a pointer that refers to a label that is ahead can be usefull, so this create (in the same manner of plus) a minus relation<br>
    <p align="center"><img src="./memory12.png"></p>  
    <p>You will see that now the RE column will have a - inside it and the tool tip will gives the address - offset. </p>
     <p align="center"><img src="./memory13.png"></p> 
   <p>You can delete a minus relation by simple using the function and selecting only Ok: the program will ask you if you want to delete it.</p>
   
   <h2>Assign the selected address as #< </h2>
   <p>In some cases a immediate value is not a simple byte but it could be the low part of one address.<br>
  <p> In you reverse a binary to source you can compile again the file back to binary and it works, but if you relocate the code to another memory position it will not works if the byte where a low part of one pointer.<br>
   It is let to your analisys to find such relation but the program will help you.<br>
   You need to select the memory location of that byte (that is the next byte after the opcode position for example) and this function will open a table where 
   all possible addresses in the binary range are equal to that byte as low part:</p>
   <p align="center"><img src="./memory10.png"></p> 
  <p> If you press Ok without select an location and there was already a mapped one, the program will ask you if it has to remove the association.<br>
   The RE column will show an < sign in that location and the tool tip will show the value of it</p>
   
   </p>
   
   <h2>Assign the selected address as #> </h2>
   <p>This function is the analoge of the previous but operates with the high part of an address. </p>
  
   <p align="center"><img src="./memory11.png"></p> 
  

   <p>As a final note you should know that you cannot mark a memory location as + and # at the same time. Only one is tollerated!</p>
